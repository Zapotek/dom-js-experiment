# DOM/JS Ruby experiment

This repo holds a few simple experiments I do on my spare time to see how easy it is to create a DOM/JS environment with/for Ruby.
The code is based on [Taka](https://github.com/tenderlove/taka) and the [V8 JS engine](http://code.google.com/p/v8/) as provided by [TheRubyRacer](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer).

It goes without saying that the lib is far from usable.

# Examples

See ```test.rb``` for a quick example.
