# DOM/JS Ruby experiment

This repo holds a few simple experiments I do on my spare time to see how easy it is to create a DOM/JS environment with/for Ruby.
The code is based on [Taka](https://github.com/tenderlove/taka) and the [V8 JS engine](http://code.google.com/p/v8/) as provided by [TheRubyRacer](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer).

It goes without saying that the lib is far from usable.

# Dependencies

To install all dependencies run: ```bundle install```

However, there's a good chance that the ```taka``` gem that's going to be installed will throw some errors. <br/>
Should that happen please download and install my fork of [Taka](https://github.com/Zapotek/taka) which is somewhat more up-to-date.


# Examples

See the ```tests``` and ```examples``` directory for examples.
